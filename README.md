# Single-Cycle-MIPS-Processor
This Single Cycle Processor uses MIPS ISA and was implemented using VHDL. For testing and analysis, modelsim was use to generate waveforms of various intructions. I was given a python-based test framework to run various assembly codes using the processor and compares the result with running same codes on MARS.
